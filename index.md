# Dreams Don’t Die: Manga, Freedom, and Contemporary Politics

This digital collection explores how iconic moments from *One Piece* connect to contemporary art, protest culture, and modern social movements. By placing manga panels next to real-world protest photos and media graphics, the project shows how a fictional story can inspire conversations about freedom, justice, identity, and solidarity.

Each item in this collection highlights a different way that Eiichiro Oda’s characters, especially Luffy and his crew, speak to political ideas. From cries of “I wanna live!” to flags raised in the streets, these images trace how fan culture and popular media become powerful tools for expressing hope and resistance.

Use the navigation above to browse the full collection, explore subjects like activism and fandom, or view the timeline to see how these images stretch from the late 1990s to today.
