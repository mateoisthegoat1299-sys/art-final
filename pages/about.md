# Curatorial Statement  
**Seas of Freedom: One Piece, Manga, and Contemporary Political Art**

In the twenty first century, the global struggle for freedom has increasingly moved into the realm of visual culture. Art, media, and narrative forms now serve as powerful channels through which individuals confront political injustice, reimagine liberation, and articulate resistance. Among the most influential cultural forces of the modern era is One Piece, Eiichiro Oda’s one of my favorite people ever created a long-running manga and anime series, whose immense global popularity reflects not only its adventurous spirit but also its deeply political storytelling. Beneath its humor, fantastical settings, and iconic characters lies a profound meditation on government power, institutional violence, censorship, racial inequality, and the universal human desire for freedom. This exhibition, “Seas of Freedom,” positions One Piece within the broader context of contemporary art to explore how popular visual culture and political consciousness intersect. The works selected drawings, digital illustrations, sequences, and curated adaptations of iconic One Piece moments are presented alongside contemporary artworks that address themes of oppression, surveillance, and liberation. Together they highlight how the fight for freedom remains both culturally specific and globally connected. One Piece is a contemporary epic about liberation. From its earliest chapters, it frames the world as a fragmented landscape ruled by corrupt institutions, the World Government exerting totalitarian control, the Marines enforcing violent order, nobility whose wealth is protected by systemic inequality, an entire island subjected to exploitation or censorship. The protagonists—the Straw Hat Pirates—embody the rebellious pursuit of individual and communal freedom. Their journey is not motivated by treasure alone but by the desire to dismantle systems of injustice and protect those oppressed by authoritarian structures. Through its vast world-building, One Piece mirrors the political realities of our own world, drawing connections to racism, slavery, colonialism, propaganda, civil war, and state-controlled violence.
This exhibition argues that One Piece functions as a contemporary political text, comparable to works of art that visualize global freedom struggles. Its imagery offers viewers a familiar yet emotionally charged lens through which to understand political issues. Like contemporary artists who use visual storytelling to confront power such as Takashi Murakami, Yoshitomo Nara, and Lu Yang, One Piece uses stylized exaggeration to reveal truths that conventional political discourse often obscures. When read alongside contemporary artworks addressing similar themes, One Piece becomes a bridge between popular culture and artistic critique, allowing audiences to connect emotionally with political struggles that may otherwise feel distant or abstract. One of the central political arcs in One Piece is Nico Robin’s backstory, known as the Ohara Incident. In this episode, the World Government annihilates an island of scholars who discover historical truths that threaten state authority. This act of censorship, cultural destruction, and political murder resonates with real-world events: book burnings under totalitarian regimes, the erasure of academic knowledge, and genocidal acts justified through fear of intellectual freedom. In this exhibition, the Ohara sequence is presented alongside contemporary works confronting the destruction of cultural heritage—highlighting how authoritarian governments weaponize knowledge suppression to maintain power.
  Another core example is the Sabaody Archipelago, where the Celestial Dragons own slaves and consider themselves superior to others by birthright. Their violence is protected by the Marines and reinforced by fear. This mirrors historical and modern systems of slavery, racial hierarchy, and unequal justice. The Celestial Dragons serve as a metaphor for elite privilege and untouchable political classes across the world. Contemporary artworks about systemic racism, police brutality, and caste inequality echo this dynamic, reinforcing the message that political oppression is not a relic of the past but a continued reality.
The Fishman Island arc confronts racism directly. Through layered allegory, it draws comparisons to segregation, civil rights movements, and generational trauma. The discrimination Fishmen face parallels real-world histories of anti-Black racism, immigration prejudice, and racialized state violence. One Piece uses emotional storytelling—symbolic imagery, exaggerated expressions, and narrative arcs—to visualize the psychological toll of racial oppression. By pairing this with contemporary artworks addressing race and identity, this exhibition shows how fictional imagery can help viewers understand real social structures.
Dressrosa offers a different political critique: dictatorship, propaganda, and media manipulation. Doflamingo’s rule resembles authoritarian regimes that rewrite history, suppress dissent, and weaponize mass media. Entire populations believe manufactured narratives designed to maintain power. This storyline parallels modern states that use propaganda, surveillance, and public misinformation to control citizens. The exhibition connects these images to artworks involving digital manipulation, state-controlled news imagery, and visual propaganda critiques.
Beyond these famous arcs, the broader world of One Piece is filled with political allegories: Wano represents isolationist policies and cultural oppression; Alabasta reflects civil war fueled by manufactured resource scarcity; Punk Hazard exposes the ethics of scientific experimentation under government orders; Marineford stages political execution as public performance; and Egghead addresses the criminalization of knowledge and the dangers of technological surveillance. Each arc reflects political anxieties in current-day society: climate crisis, migration, police militarization, misinformation, scientific ethics, and authoritarian drift. By including images from multiple arcs, this exhibition traces a lineage of political storytelling that spans fictional and real worlds.
What makes One Piece particularly effective as political imagery is its emotional accessibility. Its visual language—panels, bold lines, facial exaggeration, symbolic gestures—creates immediate emotional resonance. Manga and anime aesthetics optimize storytelling clarity: viewers grasp fear, oppression, hope, and solidarity at a glance. This is the same visual clarity that many contemporary artists pursue when addressing political themes. Takashi Murakami’s “Superflat” movement, for example, critiques consumerism and political flattening through a manga-influenced aesthetic. Yoshitomo Nara uses childlike figures to communicate vulnerability and rebellion. Lu Yang employs manga-digitized bodies to examine identity and biopolitical control. These artists demonstrate that manga aesthetics are not trivial or childish—they are deeply effective tools for political expression.
“Seas of Freedom” brings these ideas together. The exhibition treats One Piece moments not as static images but as political artworks that function within a global culture of resistance. The goal is to reframe familiar scenes—Luffy punching a Celestial Dragon, Robin screaming “I want to live!”, Jinbe declaring equality, the rebellion in Dressrosa, the liberation of Wano—as visual metaphors for struggles that real people face worldwide. The imagery becomes a mirror through which viewers recognize their own society’s structures of power.
At the same time, this exhibition challenges the boundaries between “high art” and “popular culture.” Manga and anime are global art forms with profound political impact, yet they are often excluded from traditional museum contexts. By presenting One Piece alongside contemporary political artworks, the exhibition asserts that political expression in contemporary art extends far beyond painting and sculpture. It includes digital animation, serialized narratives, fan communities, and transnational media ecosystems. These cultural forms shape how millions of people understand freedom, identity, and justice.
The concept of freedom in One Piece is both personal and collective. Characters fight not only for their own liberation but for the liberation of entire communities. Luffy’s journey embodies a radical form of anti-authoritarianism: he resists power not to dominate others but to ensure that no one controls his life or dreams. This resonates with modern liberation movements worldwide, from pro-democracy protests to campaigns against racial injustice, censorship, and state violence. The Straw Hats’ fight for freedom parallels the struggles of activists who confront oppressive governments, systemic inequality, and the erosion of human rights.
This exhibition encourages viewers to reflect on how fictional narratives can illuminate real political conditions. One Piece provides a common language that transcends borders, allowing diverse audiences to connect emotionally with political issues. By pairing these scenes with contemporary artworks, “Seas of Freedom” demonstrates that the fight for justice is universal, ongoing, and creatively expressed across cultures. Political storytelling is not limited to academic texts or news media—it thrives in manga panels, animated sequences, street art, digital installations, and the imaginations of millions of viewers worldwide.
In an era of rising authoritarianism, disinformation, mass surveillance, and global inequality, the need for accessible political art is urgent. Visual culture shapes public consciousness; it helps people imagine new futures and recognize oppressive systems. Oda’s narrative reminds us that freedom requires solidarity, courage, and the willingness to challenge injustice. Contemporary artists echo this truth through their own work, using imagery to expose power structures and imagine liberation.
“Seas of Freedom” ultimately argues that political art can be found everywhere—in museums, on screens, in comics, and in global fan communities. The exhibition invites viewers to consider how their own dreams of freedom intersect with the stories they consume. By presenting One Piece as a contemporary political narrative, this exhibition expands the boundaries of what counts as meaningful political art. It demonstrates that the struggle for freedom is not only a reality of the world we inhabit, but a story we continuously create, critique, and visualize.
